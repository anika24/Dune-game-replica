# Dune!
## By Anika Arora, Andy Dimnaku, Mehul Jangir, and Beatriz Avila-Rimer

Written as a final project for CS3, Software Design course. 
Implemented a physics engine from scratch in C and used it to make a replica of the iOS game Dune. Also developed other game demos like Pacman, Space Invaders, and Breakout using the physics engine.
